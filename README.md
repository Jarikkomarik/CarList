# CarList

Created this project to familiarize myself with java EE stack (Tomcat, Servlet, JDBC).

 Java EE WebApp - Simple web site where user can save and remove his cars. 
 
 Records are stored in DB.
 
 User identefication is based on Servlet sessions. After session expiration, user records are removed from DB.
